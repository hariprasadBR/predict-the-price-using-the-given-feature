###TASK-->predict the price using the given features.
importing the required library.
loading the data set.
get some insigt using head,shape, info and describe function.
data cleaning:
handling the missing values if the missing values and null values more the 45% in perticular column we can drop the column,more traditional way to handle the missing values is using mean,meadian,mode.
handling the oulier it is important to handel the outlier before nalysis beacuse outliesr can impact you analysis.
data cleaning also involves changing the data type with are not matching with given data.
after cleaning we do visualization of the data with the help of seaborn and matplotlib.
checking the distribution with multi-variant distribution.
bivariant distribution
univariant distribution.
Building Machine Learning Model
traning the model and feeding it to test model.
TOOL used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
